Sebastien Hoffmeister (ST10472486) Group 3

General Overview: A website made to practice my understanding of both html and ccs style coding and a way to utilise a play with some new lines of code to better my own knowledge

Design Reasoning:
Based on the case study the design is very minimalised design utilising text, 2 predominantly two colour system and different fonts.

What I learned:
I decided to take it upon myself to learn a bit of responsive web design functionality and incorporate a few new lines of style coding I haven't played around with
-'hover' condition making esentially certain style functions transform their postion in either the x or y-axis creating a pseudo hover effect
-@media applying a responsive web design feature that under a certain pixel size condition of screen the style coding will alter to accomodate that relative size

Challenges I faced:
I'm still not the best at making "Pretty" looking website designs yet so although I've been playing with it for a little while there is still a lot of visual improvements that I believe
I have yetto learn to implement, try out and even different styles of structuring that I can opt. This still serves as a learning curve that will have to be succeeded by through more
practice

Images- despite linking to the local stored images in my assets folder I wasn't able to get the images to appear, fortunately the alt compensates for it a little but I'll have to 
recheck my syntax or address links to ensure they'll link to images properly next time.

Use of External Help
I did make use of W3 schools' website particularly to learn some new tags and css style coding such as the @media however AI wasn't applied for this project, however I may personally
throw this into AI after submission to see if I can gauge a few more ideas for myself particularly regarding style coding

If I Had more time: 
I'd honestly just add more webpages for my own fun of building the site and adding more to it, maybe some videos and amimated features as that's something I need to learn for myself
and just generally polishing up the code
